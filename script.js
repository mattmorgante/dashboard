// Technical requirements: 
// Based on input, display two different boxes 
// jQuery UI Datepicker 
// Save date as a variable 
// Function to Calculate days since date was picked 
// Takes initial date as parameter, returns an integer 
// Multiply days by an array of constants, save the result as a dynamic array 
// Loop through foreach that shows a styled box for each array value 
// On document load, script runs that increases each (CONST/86400) seconds
// Where 86400 is number of seconds in a day
